# HezEngine

## How to clone
`git clone --recursive https://github.com/Hezaerd/HezEngine.git`

## First start
Start `setup.bat` inside the [scripts](https://github.com/Hezaerd/HezEngine/tree/main/scripts) folder.
It will check if you have the correct python version, install premake from github, update submodules and generate files

*Tips : No need to rerun the entire `setup.bat` after! Just run `GenerateProject.bat` at the root of the project*
